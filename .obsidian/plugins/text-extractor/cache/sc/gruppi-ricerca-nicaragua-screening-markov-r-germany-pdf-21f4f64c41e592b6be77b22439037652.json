Although several randomized trials in Europe have evaluated the eﬀectiveness of lung cancer screening programs, evidence on the cost-eﬀectiveness of lung cancer screening is scarce. Objective: To evaluate the cost-eﬀectiveness of a population-based lung cancer screening program from the perspective of a German payer. Methods: We conducted a cost-eﬀectiveness analysis from the public payer perspective for a high-risk population deﬁned as heavy former and current smokers (≥20 cigarettes per day) between 55 and 75 years of age. The underlying model consisted of two Markov models. We diﬀerentiated between a population-based annual screening program and standard clinical care. Depending on stage at diagnosis, simulated patients were assigned to one of ﬁve treatment paths according to the German clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer. Costs, life years saved, and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) were used as outcomes. Values for input parameters were taken from the literature. The model was run for 60 cycles with a cycle length of three months. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results: In the base case, annual lung cancer screening led to an increase in incremental costs (€ 1,153 per person) compared to standard clinical care. However, the screening approach was associated with an incre- mental gain in life years (0.06 per person) and QALYs (0.04 per person). Thus, the incremental cost-eﬀectiveness ratio (ICER) was € 19,302 per life year saved and € 30,291 per QALY. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis with 10,000 draws resulted in average ICERs of € 22,118 per life year and € 34,841 per QALY. Conclusion: We provide evidence that lung cancer screening for a high-risk population may be more eﬀective, but also more costly, than standard clinical care from the perspective of a German payer. 1. Introduction Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related death and the most common form of cancer worldwide [1,2]. Its incidence is highest in elderly current or former smokers [3,4]. Five-year survival is substantially increased if lung cancer is diagnosed at an early stage [5], for example through population-based screening. The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) in the United States re- ported a relative reduction in lung cancer mortality of 20% in asso- ciation with an annual population-based screening program using low- dose computed tomography (LDCT) [6]. LDCT is the method of choice due to its lower radiation dose compared to standard computed tomo- graphy (CT) and its ability to detect smaller nodules compared to x-ray scans [7]. Following approaches similar to the NLST, randomized trials have been conducted in several European countries, including Germany [8–14]. Their ﬁndings suggest that annual screening using low-dose CT is eﬀective for early diagnosis of lung cancer [10,15,16]. Moreover, evidence from the International Early Lung Cancer Action Project (I- ELCAP) – a pooled analysis of several international observational stu- dies – suggests that lung-cancer screening may achieve a stage shift and reduce mortality [17,18]. Several studies on the cost-eﬀectiveness of lung cancer screening have been conducted to date, albeit primarily in the US and Canada, where the cost of care diﬀers substantially from that in Europe [19–23]. For example, ten Haaf et al. report treatment costs for the initial care phase for stage III lung cancer patients ranging from approximately CAN$ 30,000 to CAN$ 50,000 [24], while corresponding costs for Germany are estimated to be € 20,000 (∼CAN$ 30,000) [25]. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lungcan.2018.07.036 Received 22 January 2018; Received in revised form 19 July 2018; Accepted 23 July 2018 ⁎ Corresponding author.

T Similarly, costs for CT chest examinations are reported to be two to three times higher in the US (∼US$ 200 – US$ 300) than in Germany (∼US$ 75) [19,22,26]. Evidence from Germany is limited to a study by Treskova et al. which focuses primarily on comparing the NLST and NELSON trial screening protocols. Using microsimulation, treatment costs based on UK cost data, and a high adherence rate compared to other cancer screening programs, the authors calculate incremental cost-eﬀectiveness ratios (ICERs) between € 16,754 and € 23,847 per life year gained, depending on the screening protocol [27]. German statutory health insurers currently reimburse several cancer screening programs (e.g. for breast cancer, prostate cancer, and skin cancer) but do not include lung cancer screening in their reimburse- ment scheme. This study therefore aims to evaluate the potential cost- eﬀectiveness of a population-based lung cancer screening program using LDCT from a payer perspective. 2. Methods The key advantage of lung cancer screening programs is that they make it possible to diagnose patients at an early stage of disease [6]. Capturing this in a model requires simulating the period of disease progression before diagnosis (i.e. the natural history of disease) and, separately, the treatment of lung cancer and aftercare [28]. To do so, we combined two Markov models covering both periods. Costs, life years gained, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were chosen as outcomes. We ran the model for an annual LDCT-based lung cancer screening program and for diagnosis through standard clinical care (i.e. when the patient becomes symptomatic). We considered individuals aged between 55 and 75 to be eligible for the screening program. This age range is similar to that recommended in US lung cancer screening guidelines and also reﬂects the data used to parametrize our model. This yielded a simulated cohort of 1,600,270 people, which according to a combination of data from the Federal Statistical Oﬃce and the nationwide Epidemiological Survey on Addiction equals the number of heavy current and former smokers (≥20 cigarettes per day) aged 55 to 75 within the German system of statutory health insurance (approximately 89% of the German popu- lation) [29,30]. However, the underlying data contained no informa- tion about the duration of heavy smoking habits and may – although based on best empirical evidence – be an overestimation of the number of people eligible. Prior to the ﬁrst cycle, we estimated the starting distribution of the population according to data from the ﬁrst screening round of the German LUSI trial [15]. We chose a cycle length of three months and ran the model for 60 cycles (i.e. 15 years). Half-cycle correction was applied [31]. Costs and quality-adjusted life years were discounted by 3% per year. Model calculations were conducted using the “heemod” package for R statis- tics [32]. The calibration of model parameters was performed with Microsoft Excel [33]. 2.1. Model structure We used a cohort-based Markov model because lung cancer is a non- communicable disease and there was no need to account for interaction between individuals [34]. The structure of the model was informed by recent studies evaluating the cost-eﬀectiveness of diﬀerent cancer in- terventions and on feedback from radiologists and experts in modelling [23,28,35]. As noted above, our model consisted of two separate components to distinguish between (a) the natural history of disease and (b) treatment paths and aftercare depending on patients’ lung cancer stage at diagnosis (see Fig. 1). The natural history component of our model consisted of seven states, representing lung cancer stages I to IV, a state of no apparent lung cancer, and a state for death. Lung cancer stages IIIa and IIIb were modelled separately because of diﬀerent treatment regimens [36]. The lung cancer stages in the natural history model thus represent the hypothetical stages into which the lung cancer would be classiﬁed if it were diagnosed within the current cycle. Individuals who developed lung cancers may (a) progress to any higher stage, (b) remain in their current stage, (c) get diagnosed or (d) die within the current cycle. Transition probabilities between lung cancer states and incidence rates were estimated using Bayesian calibration methods and German in- cidence data from the German Centre for Cancer Registry Data [37–39]. We set up a Metropolis Hastings algorithm with 50,000 runs and a “burn in” of 10,000 runs [33,40]. After diagnosis, the simulated patients entered the second compo- nent of our model, in which we estimated treatment and aftercare. This included ﬁve states for treatment (i.e., surgery alone; a combination of surgery and chemotherapy; a combination of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy; a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy; and palliative care), four states for aftercare (which diﬀer in the risk of death, local recurrence or distant metastases), and a state for death. The patients were assigned to treatment paths based on lung cancer stage at diagnosis. Treatment paths were designed in accordance with German clinical practice guidelines [36]. Estimates of treatment allocation were based on the Italian ITALUNG trial and expert opinion as data from the German LUSI trial were not available [11]. For example, we assumed that 90% of stage I patients were treated with surgical resection alone, 5% with a combination of surgical resection and chemotherapy, and 5% with a combination of surgical resection, chemotherapy and radio- therapy (see Table 1 for further details). After entering the aftercare states, patients were at risk of local recurrence or distant metastases [41]. In these cases, we assumed pa- tients were treated by a combination of chemo- and radiotherapy or received palliative care. In any of the states, all individuals were at risk of all-cause mortality. The probability of being diagnosed and thus entering the second component of our model diﬀered between individuals who (a) took part in the annual LDCT-based lung cancer screening program or (b) were diagnosed through standard clinical care (i.e., when they became symptomatic). Individuals in the cohort receiving standard clinical care could only be diagnosed when they developed symptoms such as cough, hemoptysis or fatigue that had been identiﬁed through a physician visit related to the symptoms. Since the model ran in three-month periods, one quarter of the participants in the screening cohort could also be diagnosed through annual CT screening in each period if they were adherent. Annual screening was assumed to follow the same screening protocol as that in the German LUSI trial, which focused on nodule size and volume doubling time (VDT) [13]. For a simpliﬁed presentation of the screening algorithm applied in the LUSI trial, see Fig. 2. 2.2. Model parameters 2.2.1. Screening eﬀectiveness and early recall rates Screening eﬀectiveness was estimated using reported screening sensitivity per lung cancer stage and tumor type from ten Haaf et al., weighted by the reported distribution of tumor types in the NELSON trial [10,42]. We accounted for adherence, which was assumed to be equal to the average adherence of established cancer screening pro- grams in Germany (such as those for breast cancer, skin cancer and prostate cancer) [43]. Early recall rates (as deﬁned in Section 2.2.3) were taken from the German LUSI trial. The authors reported an early recall rate without subsequent lung cancer diagnosis of approximately 21% for the initial screening round and a reduction to approximately 4.5% for all consecutive screening rounds [15]. All estimations for screening eﬀectiveness and early recall rates are given in Table 1. 2.2.2. Mortality We assumed that all-cause mortality would not diﬀer between the two cohorts. Mortality rates for individuals without apparent lung cancer were derived from mortality tables for the general population in Germany [44] and were allowed to vary across time [45]. Because only F. Hofer et al. Lung Cancer 124 (2018) 189–198 190 former and current heavy smokers were eligible for the screening program, mortality rates were adjusted using a time-dependent hazard ratio [46]. For lung cancer states in the natural history component of our model, we used mortality rates calibrated by the Metropolis Hastings algorithm using priors informed by results of a systematic review [47]. Results from another systematic review were used to estimate mortality rates for the treatment and aftercare component of our model [5]. 2.2.3. Measurement of costs for diagnostic procedures In the cohort receiving standard clinical care, diagnosis consisted of several procedures recommended in German clinical practice guidelines [36]. There were fewer diagnostic procedures in this cohort because individuals receiving standard clinical care must ﬁrst develop symp- toms and subsequently actively consult a physician about these. The costs of diagnosis in this cohort totaled approximately € 356 and comprised (a) an examination of past medical history (€ 28.22), (b) a chest x-ray (€ 8.87) and lump sum payment for the radiologist (€ 5.58), (c) sonography (€ 16.38), (d) a contrast-enhanced CT scan (€ 92.67), (e) an MRI scan for further staging (€ 126.59) in 80% of patients, and (f) bronchoscopy in an outpatient setting (€ 103.11). Prices were taken from the German outpatient reimbursement catalogue [26]. To estimate costs in the screening program, we assumed that each participant would receive a consultation with a radiologist and a non- enhanced low-dose CT scan (€ 68.88). For costing, we again used data from the German outpatient reimbursement catalogue. In addition, we added a lump sum of € 30 per case to represent the additional costs typically incurred in structured screening programs, such as those for documentation. Similar lump sums have been applied in established screening programs in Germany in the past (e.g. in mammography screening) [26]. In cases where the ﬁrst scan showed abnormities, the participant was either placed on early recall (3–6 months after the in- itial CT scan) or referred immediately to a pulmonologist. Participants placed on early recall underwent an additional CT scan and a second consultation with a radiologist (€ 98.88). If the second CT scan con- ﬁrmed a positive result, the patient was referred to a pulmonologist (€ 28.22) (see Fig. 2). The same costs applied to patients who had been referred to a pulmonologist immediately. For more detailed information on the proportion of early recalls and immediate referrals see Table 1. Independent of whether the participant had been referred to a pulmo- nologist immediately or after a second CT scan, 80% of patients were assumed to undergo an MRI scan for further staging and a broncho- scopy in an outpatient setting. The same costs were assumed for pa- tients who had been recalled immediately but were not subsequently diagnosed with lung cancer – the only diﬀerence being that we as- sumed, based on the results of the German LUSI trial (see Table 1), that only a small proportion of these patients received unnecessary bronchoscopies (0.49% of participants for the ﬁrst screening round and 0.18% for all consecutive screening rounds) [15]. Costs for diagnosis in the screening setting thus totaled (a) € 198 for each screening participant who had been assigned to early recall and received a negative result after a second CT, (b) € 430 for participants who had been assigned to early recall and received a positive result after a second CT, and (c) € 331 for participants who were referred immediately to a pulmonologist. 2.2.4. Measurement of costs for treatment and aftercare There was no diﬀerence in the costs of treatment and aftercare for participants in the screening program or patients receiving standard clinical care. Inpatient costs for the ﬁve treatment paths were estimated according to Schwarzkopf et al. (inﬂated to reﬂect 2016 prices), who reported costs for lung cancer treatment using administrative data from a major German statutory health insurer [25]. Because Schwarzkopf et al. used a diﬀerent subdivision of treatments, we consulted the au- thors to validate our estimations based on their study. For palliative care, we assumed that 50% of patients underwent chemotherapy and 50% received best supportive care. Note that costs for palliative care as stated in Table 1 occurred every cycle. Costs for aftercare were assumed to be € 100 per cycle. This assumption was based on the costs of pro- cedures reported in the German clinical practice guideline for lung cancer diagnosis and treatment [36]. 2.2.5. Quality of life Methods for assessing quality of life in lung cancer patients vary widely, diﬀer in quality, and lead to a wide range of reported values [48,49]. We applied pooled quality of life scores taken from a meta- Death No lung cancer Lung cancer stage I Lung cancer stage II Lung cancer stage IIIA Lung cancer stage IIIB Lung cancer stage IV * Simplified presentation.

Following that approach, quality of life scores for late- stage lung cancer patients in our model were comparable to those re- ported for German patients [50]. For people without a lung cancer di- agnosis, we used baseline quality of life scores for people aged between 55 and 75 years in Germany [51]. We did not adjust quality of life scores for screened individuals who had been assigned to early recall in our base case scenario because indeterminate results did not impact the quality of life reported by the NLST [52]. However, impairment of quality of life for patients undergoing unnecessary bronchoscopies was taken into account following the approach of Mahadevia et al. and a systematic review by Earle et al. [23,53]. 2.3. Sensitivity analysis We conducted seven deterministic one-way sensitivity analyses to examine model sensitivity to diﬀerent parameters. To do so, rates of newly developed cancers (equal to the underlying population risk), adherence, early recall rates, and costs for screening were varied by +/- 50%. Furthermore, we simulated a variation in the intervention by assuming biennial or semi-annual screening intervals and altered the time horizon (to 10 and 20 years respectively) and discount rate.

Input parameters were ran- domly drawn from beta, gamma or Dirichlet distributions (see Table 1) [54,55]. 3. Results Following the intention-to-treat approach, our model suggested a surplus of 0.06 life years (0.04 QALYs) per person in the screening cohort compared to those receiving standard clinical care. The average costs per person amounted to € 2,787 in the standard clinical care co- hort and € 3,940 in the screening cohort. The diﬀerence was attribu- table mainly to screening costs associated with the high number of CT scans in the screening cohort (9,398,585 over 15 years, see Table 2). Based on the assumption of an eligible population of 1,600,270 people in Germany, our simulation resulted in an incremental gain of 95,581 life years (60,906 QALYs) and an incremental budget impact of € 1.84 billion for the screening program over 15 years. The higher costs of screening were due to the screening itself (about 71% of the diﬀerence) but also to treatment (27%) and aftercare (2%) for substantially higher numbers of diagnoses at an early stage. Compared to standard clinical care, the ICERs for an annual screening program were € 19,302 per life year saved and € 30,291 per QALY gained. Fig. 3 shows model sensitivity for the abovementioned parameters. Overall, model results were robust with no variation exceeding ∼€ 31,000 per life year gained or ∼€ 48,000 per QALY gained. The highest sensitivity was observed for the rate of newly developed cancers, especially in cases where this rate was lower than calibrated by the Metropolis Hastings algorithm. Screening intervals (i.e. biennial or semi-annual) and the cost of screening also had a relatively large in- ﬂuence on the ICERs, especially in the cost-utility analysis. In contrast, variations in early recall rates changed the ICERs to a smaller degree. If a longer time horizon (i.e., 20 years) would be chosen the ICERs would decrease to € 16,260 per life year and € 27,176 per QALY respectively. After 10,000 repetitions, the Monte Carlo simulation revealed average ICERs of € 22,118 per life year and € 34,841 per quality ad- justed life year, both of which are above our base case ICERs (Fig. 4). 4. Discussion We provide evidence on the cost-eﬀectiveness and cost-utility of a population-based lung cancer screening program for a high-risk popu- lation comprising current and former heavy smokers. To our knowl- edge, we are the ﬁrst to do so using cost data from a German payer and treatment algorithms based on a German lung cancer screening trial. According to our base case, the program leads to higher costs but also to a gain in life years and QALYs. Although there is no oﬃcial cost-ef- fectiveness threshold in Germany for accepting or rejecting health in- terventions, the program would be regarded as cost-eﬀective according to the threshold used by the World Health Organization (WHO) (∼€ 48,000 per QALY) [56]. Sensitivity analysis suggests that our results are robust. Compared to the ICERs for established cancer screening programs in Germany, the ICERs in our base case analysis appear to be at a level that would be acceptable to German health insurers. A cost-utility analysis for colorectal cancer screening, for example, reported an ICER of € 12,200 per QALY [57], and a cost-eﬀectiveness analysis for cervical cancer screening reported an ICER of € 28,400 per life year gained [58]. Changing our interval for screenings suggested that a biennial screening approach would be less cost-eﬀective than an annual approach (€ 24,594 per life year gained and € 38,694 per QALY gained), while a semi-annual screening interval led to lower ICERs (€ 16,711 per life year gained and € 26,076 per QALY gained). This is in concordance with the ﬁndings of a recently published Canadian study [24]. How- ever, another Canadian study, which incorporated quality of life, found biennial screening intervals to be superior to annual screening intervals [59]. Several previous cost-eﬀectiveness studies have yielded similar re- sults for high-risk populations, albeit in Canada and the US. A recently published German microsimulation reported ICERs between € 16,754 and € 23,847 per additional life year depending on the screening pro- tocol [27]. They did not report ICERs after quality adjustment of life years. Aside from their diﬀerent modelling approach, the diﬀerence between our ICERs and those reported by Treskova et al. is attributable mainly to distinct assumptions regarding adherence rates, time horizon of lung cancer screening and estimated costs. For example, Treskova et al. included costs for positron emission tomography (PET), which is not generally reimbursed by German statutory health insurers in an outpatient setting. Nevertheless, some lung cancer patients may have access to PET. If we were to assume that 10% of lung cancer patients in our model undergo PET scans, our ICERs would increase by approxi- mately € 600. Further diﬀerences are due to the estimation of costs for lung cancer treatment. Whereas Treskova et al. based their cost esti- mation on UK cost data, we chose to use claims data from a German statutory health insurer as reported and validated by Schwarzkopf et al. Furthermore, Treskova et al. assumed in their base case that a lung cancer screening sessions would cost €150, while we assumed a cost of € 99. A recently published cost-eﬀectiveness study from Switzerland reported ICERs between € 24,972 and € 48,369 per life year gained and between € 35,674 and € 69,099 per QALY gained, depending on the evaluated screening scenario [60]. While Switzerland is comparable to Germany in terms of health care delivery, it is less so in terms of re- imbursement rates and hence health care costs. US and Canadian studies that included results from the NLST found LDCT screening to be cost-eﬀective, with ICERs of US$ 34,000 per life year gained [24], US$ 58,000 per life year gained [19], US$ 28,300 per QALY [22] and US$ 81,000 per QALY [19]. In contrast, older studies that did not consider results from the NLST were inconclusive, re- porting ICERs of US$ 19,000 per life year gained [21] and US$ 144,000 to 207,000 per QALY [20]. One explanation for our lower ICERs is the substantially lower cost of health care in Germany, which leads to lower costs for early recalls, treatment and lung cancer screening sessions. In our model, lung cancer screening led to a 2.25% reduction in all- cause mortality after 5 years. After 15 years, this number fell to 0.83%. The largest international trial, the NLST, reported a 20% reduction of lung cancer speciﬁc mortality and a 6.7% reduction of all-cause mor- tality [6]. Incorporating the adherence rate of the NLST (90%) for the screening cohort into our model (adherence in base case: 54%) would result in a 3.54% reduction of 5-year (all-cause) mortality. These ﬁndings are in line with Treskova et al. and Tomonaga et al., who found lung cancer speciﬁc mortality reduction in German and Swiss screening settings to be substantially lower than that of the NLST [27,60]. Early recall rates and false positive results are a major concern in cancer screening programs [61]. The LUSI trial reported lower early recall rates (approximately 21% for the initial screening round and approximately 4.5% for subsequent rounds) than the NLST, which is probably due to a more rigorous screening protocol [6,15]. The NELSON trial and the DLCST, which used screening protocols similar to Table 2 Resource consumption. Procedure Frequency (over 15 years) standard care cohort screening cohort CT screening sessions – 9,398,585 early recalls – 547,834 true positives – 76,588 Surgery 11,570 36,365 Surgery + chemotherapy 10,850 26,658 Surgery + chemotherapy + radiotherapy 13,606 24,228 Chemotherapy + radiotherapy 16,880 15,763 Palliative care (number of patients) 106,286 98,442 F. Hofer et al. Lung Cancer 124 (2018) 189–198 194 those in the LUSI trial, reported even lower early recall rates [16,62]. As a result, our estimation of early recall rates can be regarded as conservative. In our model, the screening program led to 547,834 early recalls. Applying the early recall rates seen in the NLST (23%), the NELSON trial (approximately 19% for initial screening round and ap- proximately 1% for subsequent rounds) and the DLCST (approximately 8% for initial screening round and approximately 2% for subsequent rounds) would result in 2,069,394, 254,901 and 212,817 early recalls in our simulation, respectively. The corresponding ICERs per QALY would be € 52,065, € 26,106 and € 25,556. Within the CUA component of our study, the inﬂuence of early re- calls was captured in two dimensions: (a) additional costs due to re- peated CT examinations and (b) dis-utilities due to mental stress asso- ciated with retrospectively unnecessary biopsies [23,53]. Based on the ﬁndings of the NLST, we assumed that there were no dis-utilities for patients with indeterminate screening results [52]. If we allowed for dis-utilities caused by indeterminate results of 0.015 or 0.03, however, the corresponding ICERs per QALY gained would increase to € 30,381 and € 32,185 compared to standard clinical care. There are also practical issues in implementing a population-based lung cancer screening program. First, it is questionable how quickly population-based CT screening could become accessible in Germany, especially in rural areas. This is important, as there is evidence that screening uptake is correlated with physician density and distance be- tween screening participants and providers [63]. Before implementing such a program, it would thus be necessary to ensure that the infra- structure in place could guarantee suﬃcient access or could be im- proved to do so at a reasonable cost. Second, the fact that this program would serve only a high-risk population of smokers with self-inﬂicted health risks might pose a political hurdle. German statutory health in- surers are not allowed to distinguish between high-risk and low-risk individuals when calculating premiums. Because resources for health care are ﬁnite, providing additional services for people with self-in- ﬂicted health risks – even if doing so is cost-eﬀective – might prove controversial among the general public [64]. Our model has several important limitations. First, we did not in- clude the eﬀect of cumulative radiation exposure on screening partici- pants [65]. Attending annual LDCT screenings over 15 years with an assumed average radiation dosage of 1.5 mSv would result in an addi- tional cumulative radiation exposure of 22.5 mSv per patient [66]. However, due to additional radiation exposure caused by subsequent examination of potential cases of lung cancer, the cumulative radiation dosage may be substantially higher in total [67]. Nevertheless, recent studies suggest that the potential beneﬁts of lung cancer screening in preventing death are higher than the potential harm of increased ra- diation exposure [68,69]. Second, due to a lack of data we were neither Fig. 3. Tornado diagrams. F. Hofer et al. Lung Cancer 124 (2018) 189–198 195 able to determine the actual duration of heavy smoking behavior, nor the time passed since individuals changed their (heavy) smoking habits. This may aﬀect the number of people eligible for screening and thus total budget impact / total life years saved. Furthermore, our base case results regarding resource consumption (e.g. number of early recalls, number of screening sessions) have to be interpreted with caution, as they are highly dependent on the underlying properties of our cohort [24,27]. However, to most extend changes of the underlying properties of our cohort and its inﬂuence on the ICERs were most likely captured within our sensitivity analyses. Third, health behavior may be aﬀected by introducing a lung cancer screening program. For example, the NELSON trial found that individuals with negative screening results were more adherent, thus leading to selection issues. Moreover, current smokers were more likely to participate in subsequent screening rounds, indicating that lung cancer screening programs might be per- ceived as a “health reassurance” for high-risk individuals [62]. In contrast, a study investigating the eﬀect of telling people their lung age before a smoking cessation intervention found that a substantial portion of individuals with a favorable lung age quit smoking after the inter- vention. The authors assumed that smokers might recognize that it is not too late to stop smoking [70]. Fourth, due to our cohort-based modelling approach, we were not able to reliably estimate the number of potentially overdiagnosed in- dividuals, which is a major concerns regarding (lung) cancer screenings [61]. Treskova et al. estimated that overdiagnoses may account for between 9 and 22 percent of total lung cancer diagnoses, depending on Fig. 4. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses. F. Hofer et al. Lung Cancer 124 (2018) 189–198 196 the modelled screening scenario [27]. Fifth, diagnosis and treatment for small cell lung cancer (SCLC) was not modelled separately. These were, however, implicitly included because incidence was reported within European and US RCTs and in the cost data by Schwarzkopf et al. [6,8,11,15,16,25,62,71]. However, because SCLC is associated with high treatment costs even after early diagnosis, our model may un- derestimate the cost of treatment. Given a prevalence of SCLC within the European RCTs of 5% and 14% [15,16], the impact of not having modelled diagnosis and treatment of SCLC on our results is likely to be low. Sixth, the prevalence of so called “grey screenings” is unknown. Some insured individuals may have access to full dose CT scans beyond a screening program for various reasons [72]. If the proportion of these individuals were high, it would mean that our model would over- estimate the incremental eﬀect of a structured LDCT-screening program in terms of life years / QALYs gained and costs. Seventh, using payer data from 2015 may have led us to underestimate the cost of che- motherapy because new agents have entered the market since then. For example, the number of personalized therapies, which are associated with substantially higher costs for payers, is increasing. Incorporating a 50% increase in expenses for all treatment paths associated with che- motherapeutic agents results in ICERs of € 20,334 per life year gained and € 31,911 per QALY gained, respectively. Eighth, as our cohort is 64 years old on average, we did not consider indirect costs due to sick pay. Given the cohort model approach it is not possible to reliably estimate the proportion of lung cancer patients that are still part of the workforce at the moment of their diagnosis. Finally, we implicitly assumed that individuals in the screening cohort did not change their radiologist. As mentioned by Becker et al., the reported drop in early recall rates may be lower if the choice of radiologist is at the patient’s discretion [15]. However, as shown by our one-way sensitivity analyses, the eﬀect of a smaller drop in early recall rates is small as it does not aﬀect screening sensitivity. 5. Conclusion We provide evidence that a population-based lung cancer screening program in Germany for heavy smokers using low-dose computed to- mography is more eﬀective, but also more costly, than standard clinical care. Compared to established screening programs and the WHO threshold for cost-eﬀectiveness analyses, the intervention would be cost-eﬀective. The budget impact of the intervention, however, would be high, totaling € 1.84 billion over 15 years. Moreover, the cost-ef- fectiveness of the intervention is due to heavy smokers having a much higher likelihood of developing lung-cancer – a behavioral aspect of the intervention that might represent a political challenge to its im- plementation. Future research may beneﬁt from using patient-level data from ongoing RCTs to analyze the cost-eﬀectiveness of the screening program for diﬀerent subgroups of patients.
